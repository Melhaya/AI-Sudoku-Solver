Sudoku is one of the world's most popular puzzles. It consists of a 9x9 grid, and the objective is to fill the grid with digits in such a way that each row, each column, and each of the 9 principal 3x3 subsquares contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
The puzzle is given as a partially completed grid, and the goal is to fill in the missing numbers. Below is an example of such a grid.
